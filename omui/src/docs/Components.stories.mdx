# Components

Components are the primary building-blocks of the OMUI system. They are often comprised of multiple Primitives, but can even be built by combining the Components themselves.

To fully understand how all components in OMUI work, it's best that you first understand how styled props in Styled System (and Chakra) work. We suggest you read the following pieces of Chakra documentation before continuing on:

- [Chakra Design Principles](https://chakra-ui.com/principles)
- [Styled Props](https://chakra-ui.com/style-props)
- [Responsive Styles](https://chakra-ui.com/responsive-styles)

Once you have a firm grasp of these basic concepts, you can easily browse through the list of components on the left-hand side at your own discretion.
