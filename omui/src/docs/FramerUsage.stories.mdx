## Basic Installation

The OMUI Framer package is deployed to the public package directory for framer. You can find it here: <!-- TODO: Fill in the link here -->. For more information on how to add Framer packages to your project, [please check out this documentation](https://www.framer.com/support/using-framer/packages/).

Our Framer library is developed in the same repository as our UI component system for usage in code. This allows any changes to the coded component system to be automatically reflected in the Framer component system.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to our Framer library, please contact Patrick Cason (**@cereallarceny** on Slack). Note that you must have the Framer desktop application for Mac in order to properly work on the Framer package.
